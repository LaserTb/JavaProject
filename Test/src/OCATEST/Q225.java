//The code will fail to compile since the instance initializer tries to assign a value to a static member.

//The value 5 is passed to the constructor to the local (automatic) variable m. So the instance variable m is shadowed. Before the body of the constructor is executed, the instance initializer is executed and assigns values 30 and 40 to variables j and i2, respectively. A class is loaded when it is first used. For example,
//class A1{
//  static int i = 10;
//  static { System.out.println("A1 Loaded "); }
//}
//public class A{
//  static { System.out.println("A Loaded "); }
//  public static void main(String[] args){
//    System.out.println(" A should have been loaded");
//    A1 a1 = null;
//    System.out.println(" A1 should not have been loaded");
//    System.out.println(a1.i);
//  }
//}
//
//
//When you run it you get the output:
//A Loaded
// A should have been loaded
// A1 should not have been loaded
//A1 Loaded
//10
//Now, A should be loaded first as you are using its main method. Even though you are doing A1 a1 = null; A1 will not be loaded as it is not yet used (so the JVM figures out that it does not need to load it yet.) When you do a1.i, you are using A1, so before you use it, it must be loaded. That's when A1 is loaded. Finally 10 is printed.
