//1. All static constants, variables, and blocks. 
//Among themselves the order is the order in which they appear in the code.
//This step is actually a part of "class initialization" 
//rather than "instance initialization". 
//Class initialization happens only if the class is being
//used for the first time while being instantiated. For example,
//if you have invoked a static method of a class or accessed a 
//static field of that class earlier in the code, 
//you have already used the class and the JVM would have 
//performed initialization of this class at that time. Thus,
//there wouldn't be any need to initialize the class 
//if you instantiate an object of this class now. 
//
//Further, if the class has a superclass, then the JVM performs 
//this step for the superclass first (if the superclass hasn't 
//		been initialized already) and only after the superclass 
//		is initialized and static blocks are executed, 
//		does the JVM proceed with this class. This process
//		is followed recursively up to the java.lang.Object class.
//
//2. All non static constants, variables, and blocks.
//Among themselves the order is the order in which they appear in the code. 
//
//3. Constructor.
//
//Just like the class initialization, instance initialization 
//also happens for the superclass first. That is, if the class
//has a superclass, then the JVM takes steps 2 
//and 3 given above for the superclass first 
//and only after the superclass's instance members are initialized, 
//does the JVM proceed with this class. This process is also followed 
//recursively up to the java.lang.Object class
