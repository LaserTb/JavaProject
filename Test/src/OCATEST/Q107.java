class SomeClass{
   String s1 = "green mile";   // 0
   public void generateReport( int n ){
      String local;   // 1
      if( n > 0 ) local = "good";   //2

//Please select 2 options.

//Insert after line 2 : else local = "bad";
//
//Insert after line 2 : if(n <= 0) local = "bad";

//Move line 1 and place it after line 0.

//change line 1 to : final String local = "rocky";
//
//The program already is without any errors.
//
//The problem is that local is declared inside a method is therefore local 
//to that method. It is called a local variable (also known as automatic variable)
//and it cannot be used before initialized. Further, 
//it will not be initialized unless you initialize 
//it explicitly because local variables are not initialized 
//by the JVM on its own. The compiler spots the usage 
//of such uninitialized variables and ends with an error message. 
//1. Making it a member variable (choice "Move line 1 and place it after line 0.") 
//will initialize it to null. 2. Putting an else part 
//(choice "Insert after line 2 : else local = "bad";") 
//will ensure that it is initialized to either 'good' or 'bad'. 
//So this also works. Choice "Insert after line 2 : "
//		+ "if(n <= 0) local = "bad";" doesn't work because the second 'if'
//		will actually be another statement and is not considered as a part of first 
//		'if'. So, compiler doesn't realize that 'local' 
//		will be initialized even though it does get initialized.
