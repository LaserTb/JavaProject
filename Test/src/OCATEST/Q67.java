//This question tests your knowledge on the default values of uninitialized primitives and object references. booleans are initialized to false, numeric types to 0 and object references to null. Elements of arrays are initialized to the default values of their types. So, elements of a boolean array are initialized to false. int, char, float to 0 and Objects to null.  
//In this case, b is false. So the else part of if(b) is executed. ch is a numeric type so its value is 0. ba[0] = false assigns false to ba[0] and returns false which is assigned to x. Finally, x and ba[0] are printed as false false.
