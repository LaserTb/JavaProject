//Class B extends class A.                      ja
//
//Class B is the superclass of class A.
//
//Class A inherits from class B.

//Here are a few good words from the Java Language Specification:
//Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited 
//by subclasses of that class. Only members of a class that are 
//declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses declared 
//in a package other than the one in which the class is declared.
//Constructors and static initializers are not members and therefore are not inherited
